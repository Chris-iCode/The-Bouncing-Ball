# The-Bouncing-Ball
In this project I use canvas in html to have a single red ball bounce in a small area and have three different colored balls sit idle that bounce in a different area when my javascript file is added to it.
# Usage
Mainly my intent was get an understanding of how movement works with javascript and how to create different functions to do different things.
# Roadmap
In the future I would like to have hundreds of balls set in columns and rows come together in center screen into one ball that changes into three colors before explodeing into a spiral of balls that change shape as they spread apart.
